The Rails Foundation has launched a few more learning resources for beginners, in partnership with Chris Oliver and the team behind Typecraft - Chris Power and Robert Beene.

Here’s what they are and where you can find them:

**New tutorial: `Sign Up & Settings`**

When we updated the Getting Started tutorial <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/12/13/learn-Rails-8-tutorial-and-unpacked-videos">last year</a>, we designed it to be the foundation for a series of follow‑up tutorials that add real features to the e‑commerce app you build, helping you grow your Rails skills step by step.

This is also why we changed the app in the Getting Started tutorial from a _blog_ to an _e‑commerce shop_. A shop offers more opportunity to add meaningful features (features that you might also add to a real app).

Today, we’re launching the first of those add‑on tutorials: <a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/sign_up_and_settings.html">Sign Up & Settings</a>. 

Learn how to create admins for your store and allow users to sign up and edit their own profiles, and learn other useful techniques along the way, like adding rate‑limiting, creating nested layouts, and writing tests for users with different roles.

_Next up in written tutorials_: **`User Wishlists`**

Want to help by reviewing? The PR for **User Wishlists** is already up. Add your review <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55428">here</a>.

_Big thank you to **Chris Oliver** for this continued collaboration! Special thanks also to those who helped review the tutorial before we merged: **Collin Jilbert**, **leegeng**, **gregmolnar**, **NorGrm**, **skipkayhil**l, **MatheusRich**, **brunoprietog**, and **GithinjiV**._

**New video tutorial: `Rails New` with Typecraft**

What if you’re more of a visual learner? We’ve got something for you too. 

A few weeks ago we launched **`Rails New`**, a beginner-friendly series hosted by the team at Typecraft. This new series takes you from installation to `rails new` to a fully deployed productivity app, all in just 10 videos. 

Perfect for newcomers to Rails who prefer to learn by watching. You’ll learn Rails philosophy and core concepts like MVC, scaffolding, and CRUD, style your app with TailwindCSS, and deploy with Kamal. 

Check out the full playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHFP2OPUpCeZcPutT9yn4-e0bMmrn5Gd1">here</a>.

_Next up in video tutorials_: **A `Front-end series` with Typecraft**

Because you keep asking, and we are listening. Expect that by the end of the year.

_Big thank you to **Chris Power** and **Robert Beene** from Typecraft for this collaboration! Also thanks to the **Rails Core** team and members of the **Rails Foundation** for their input and reviews._

**New tutorial landing page**

And finally, to support the expansion of the tutorials we are offering, we’ve also launched a dedicated <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/docs/tutorials">Tutorial landing page</a>. 

This new hub (reached from the [Docs](/docs) landing page) provides a single home for all of the official Rails tutorials, making them easier for beginners to find and follow. 

_Next up_: Adding links to our video tutorials so that this landing page is the **one spot** you need to learn Rails, whether that’s by written or video tutorials.

_Big thank you to **John Athayde** for working on this landing page._

**

**All this work is made possible by the members of the Rails Foundation.**

Our Core and Contributing members often cite the Education pillar of our [mission](/foundation) as one they find most crucial for the ongoing sustainability of the Rails ecosystem. This work wouldn't be possible without their support. 

Offering new learning resources for beginners is just one way we are working towards that mission. We have other ideas, but if you have some too, <a href="https://app.todohelpers.com/forms/4758b5b0-d6f9-4f41-8041-992cc9b748fb">we'd love to hear from you</a>.
