As we approach the last ever <a href="https://railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a> July 8 to 10 in Philadelphia, the Rails Foundation is looking forward to joining the Ruby Central and the Rails community to celebrate 20 years of history.

> For the final RailsConf, we decided to make the theme _The Past, Present, and Future of Rails_. We have so many years of rich history to look back on since the very first RailsConf in 2006.
> 
> Rails has evolved so much over the years – from the days before Bundler existed, to merging Merb into Rails, to the introductions of ActiveStorage, ActiveJob, etc and now the Hotwire-era. We will celebrate everything that we've learned over the years and everyone who has been a part of the community that makes all this possible.

The <a href="https://railsconf.org/speakers/">speaker lineup</a> has been announced, and it’s shaping up to be **one for the books**, including a **fireside chat with DHH**, and talks by Rails team members **Eileen Uchitelle** (Core), **Gannon McGibbon** (Committers), **Hartley McGuire** (Issues), and **Matheus Richard** (Triage).

We’ll also check out the panel where **Rosa Gutiérrez**, Rails Foundation board member and 37signals developer, will discuss ‘The Past, Present, and Future of Background Jobs’. Those interested will also find Rosa in the Hacker Space on day 2, working on Solid Queue.

Tickets are still available, so <a href="https://ti.to/railsconf/2025">grab one</a> while you can. This final RailsConf is one you don’t want to miss.

See you in Philly!
