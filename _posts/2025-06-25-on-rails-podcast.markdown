There’s no shortage of podcasts about new tools, trending libraries, and web development hot takes. But what’s often missing are the deeper conversations, the ones about _how_ teams actually made things work in production, under pressure, and with real-world constraints.

That’s the gap we’re hoping to close with 🎙️ <a href="https://onrails.buzzsprout.com/">On Rails</a>.

Produced by [The Rails Foundation](/foundation), _On Rails_ is a new podcast focused on the technical decisions, architectural trade-offs, and long-term thinking behind building and maintaining Ruby on Rails applications.

This podcast isn’t about chasing the latest trends. It’s about understanding the choices that help teams ship and sustain reliable software over time. You’ll hear from engineers and leaders who’ve navigated legacy code, scaled monoliths, introduced new tools, and kept Rails apps running smoothly for years.

**🎧 Season One: What to Expect**

We’re experimenting with a few different episode formats:
- Deep-dive case studies
- Panel discussions
- Technical retrospectives
- Tech stack spotlights

Yes, we’ll talk about newer gems and features, but always through the lens of _why_ they came to be, _how_ they were implemented, and what was learned along the way. These episodes aim to move beyond surface-level highlights and into practical, often messy realities.

**👋 About Your Host**

I’m Robby Russell, a long-time member of the Rails community and your host for On Rails. Through my work with clients at <a href="https://www.planetargon.com">Planet Argon</a> and as the host of _<a href="https://maintainable.fm">Maintainable.fm</a>_, I’ve spent years talking with engineers about the challenges of building and sustaining real-world software. This podcast is a way to share more of those candid, behind-the-scenes conversations with the broader Rails community.

**🚀 Available Now**

You can listen to _On Rails_ at <a href="https://onrails.buzzsprout.com/">onrails.buzzsprout.com</a>, or in your favorite podcast app. Subscribe if you’re into that sort of thing.

We’re also proud to be launching the show on <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/">Buzzsprout</a>, which is also built on Rails.

New episodes will be released regularly, but we’re not chasing a publishing quota. Our focus is on real conversations that reveal how Rails teams build systems that last.
We hope _On Rails_ becomes a valuable resource for developers and teams looking to build and maintain great software with Ruby on Rails.
