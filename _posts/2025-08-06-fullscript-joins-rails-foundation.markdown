The Rails Foundation is happy to welcome <a href="https://fullscript.com/">Fullscript</a> our newest Contributing member.

**Fullscript** is a leading healthcare platform powering whole person care, helping over **100,000 providers** and **10 million patients** with seamless access to high-quality supplements, industry-leading labs, and smart adherence tools via a full suite of clinical tools built on Rails.

Fullscript launched on Rails 3.2 in 2011, and that original Rails monolith now runs on **Rails 7.2** (with Rails 8 on the horizon), has over **1.6 million lines of Ruby**, and leverages the new SolidQueue for background jobs. It serves both an internal GraphQL API for their React MPA, and an external REST API, and connects to 3 separate databases - two MySQL and one PostgreSQL.

>Ruby on Rails has been at the heart of our platform since day one. It helped us move fast in the early days, and it’s scaled with us to serve tens of millions of users. As we’ve grown, Rails continues to deliver on its promise of developer productivity and software quality. We’re proud to support the Rails Foundation and give back to the community that’s been such a big part of our journey.<br>

Today, Fullscript’s platform has scaled to **$1 billion in annual revenue**, and Rails has been there every step of the way, powering all of the core interactions for their patients and medical providers.

In addition to joining the Rails Foundation, Fullscript supports their local Ruby and Rails community, sponsoring Ruby meetups in Ottawa and Toronto, and sponsoring Rails World speakers last year in Toronto.

We’re excited to have them join the foundation and we are especially grateful for their commitment to the Rails community. 

The Fullscript team will be joining us at the Rails at Scale Summit and Rails World this year, so if you see them, be sure to say hi.
