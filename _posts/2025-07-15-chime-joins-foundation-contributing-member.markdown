The Rails Foundation is excited to share our newest Contributing member, one that Americans will be very familiar with: <a href="https://www.chime.com/">Chime Financial</a>.

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-chime.svg" style="width: 50%"></p>

Chime is a financial technology company founded on the belief that core banking services should be helpful, easy, and free. Since its inception, Chime has used Ruby on Rails to build and scale a platform that empowers millions of members with access to fee-free financial services. 

Their engineering team includes hundreds of Ruby developers who rely on Rails to manage transactions, improve security, and drive innovation. As of Q1 2025, Chime has 8.6 million active members, and is one of the most downloaded banking apps in America.

>Rails has been core to Chime’s technology from the very beginning. When we were building Chime, we chose Ruby on Rails because it allowed us to iterate quickly and create a seamless experience for our members. We’re excited to support the continued growth of the Rails community through education, collaboration, and shared best practices.

Chime has a strong history of supporting the Ruby and Rails communities. They are a longtime sponsor of Ruby Central and Ruby Central’s events, and have also supported regional events like Madison Ruby. They also regularly host Ruby meetups in both their Chicago and San Francisco offices. 

We’re excited to have Chime’s support and appreciate their continued investment in the Ruby and Rails ecosystem!
