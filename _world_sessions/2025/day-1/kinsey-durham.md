Prompting is a start, but agents are the future. In this talk, we’ll explore how intelligent agents are changing how we build software — and how we can bring them to life in the Rails ecosystem. From early CLI bots to multi-tool agents powered by LLMs, we’ll trace the evolution, show what’s working in production, and give you practical patterns for building agents with a Rails mindset.
