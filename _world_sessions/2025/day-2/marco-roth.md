This talk is the conclusion of a journey I’ve been sharing throughout 2025. At RubyKaigi, I introduced Herb: a new HTML-aware ERB parser and tooling ecosystem. At RailsConf, I released developer tools built on Herb, including a formatter, linter, and language server, alongside a vision for modernizing and improving the Rails view layer. 

At Rails World, I’ll debut ReActionView: a new ERB engine built on Herb, fully compatible with `.html.erb` but with HTML validation, better error feedback, reactive updates, and built-in tooling. 

This will be the first public release, exclusive to Rails World, tying together everything from the past talks and even bringing exclusive updates to tools I first showed at Rails World 2023.
