This talk showcases ways to take a traditional Rails app and shape it around your product domainâ€”while also using Rails tools in ways you might not have considered.

Topics include:
- Creating your own app/ folders for domain concepts
- Creating your own generators
- Organizing features by modules and concerns (e.g., the User model may have teams, billing, etc., organized under app/models/user/)
- Adding domainwording and class methods, like allow_unauthenticated_access or rate_limit
